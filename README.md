# Minecraft Chat Command-Line Interface
A simple NodeJS program that lets you connect to Minecraft servers and interact with chat.

## Setup
1. Download and extract the code.
2. Open your code editor and run `npm i`. This will download the required libraries to run properly.
3. Open `credentials.json` and replace `<MinecraftAccountEmailHere>` and `<MinecraftAccountPasswordHere>` with your minecraft login credentials. These are stored on your machine.
4. Run `npm start` to load the code and join the Foundation Craft server. When a text box pops up in the console, you are now connected and ready to interact with chat.
